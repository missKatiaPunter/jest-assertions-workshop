# What are Assertions?


## Below is what I personally believe Assertions are with one benifit and limitation: 

- An assertion is a boolean value function which essentially returns a true or false;
- The main benefit of assertions in testing is that it indetifies any potential faults in the programme;
- Assertions are used to detect any possible subtle errors which may go unoticed and impact the success of the code;
- A limitation of assertion is that it may sometimes fail to report bugs that exist;

### The aim of the workshop is to:
* Write and refactor functions
* To write tests
* To get familiar with jest 



## Instructions for this workshop are as follows:
