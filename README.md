# What are Assertions?


Below is what I personally believe Assertions are with one benifit and limitation: 

- An assertion is a boolean value function which essentially returns a true or false;
- The main benefit of assertions in testing is that they indetify any potential faults in the programme;
- Assertions are used to detect any possible subtle errors which may go unoticed and impact the success of the code;
- A limitation of assertion is that they may sometimes fail to report bugs that exist;

> The aim of the workshop is to:

* Write and refactor functions
* To write tests
* To get familiar with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started)



Instructions for this workshop are as follows: 



The first instruction in this workshop is to edit the README


Then someone else can make changes:):
